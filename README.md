###Part 3: What are the pros and cons of TDD?
Advantages:
- Efficient Code: Ensures only necessary code is written, leading to simpler and more efficient codebases.
- Modular Design: Promotes a modular and decoupled design, as each microfeature is considered individually.
- Maintainability: Enhances maintainability due to clear interfaces and decoupled components.
- Ease of Refactoring: Facilitates safe and easy refactoring, with tests ensuring functionality remains intact.
- High Test Coverage: Naturally results in high test coverage, boosting confidence in the code.
- Documentation: Tests serve as documentation, demonstrating proper usage and functionality.
- Reduced Debugging: Minimizes time spent on debugging, as issues are often caught early.
Disadvantages:
- Initial Slowdown: Can feel slower at the outset, requiring thoughtful design and test writing before coding.
- Team Consistency: Requires all team members to adopt TDD for consistent code design and quality.
- Maintenance Overhead: Tests must be updated alongside code when requirements change, adding to maintenance tasks.
